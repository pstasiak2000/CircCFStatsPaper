\section{Method}

\begin{figure*}

  \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{snapshots.pdf}
  \caption{Visualisation of turbulent vortex tangles. (\emph{a}) Counterflow-induced turbulence generated at $T = 2.1$ K with a counterflow velocity of $v_{ns} = \bar{v}_n - \bar{v}_s = 0.94$ cm/s. The blue and red surface rendering shows the normalised kinetic energy density of normal fluid fluctuations $E'_n/E'_{max}$ where $E'_n = |\v_n - \bar{\v}_n|^2$. (\emph{b}) Turbulence generated by an initial Taylor-Green configuration (see Supplementary Materials for details). In both (\emph{a}) and (\emph{b}) superfluid vortex lines are represented as green tubes with exaggerated size.}
  \label{fig:snapshots}
\end{figure*}

Superfluid dynamics are modelled by employing the recently developed \textsc{FOUCAULT} model \cite{galantucci2020}. 
We follow Schwarz's approach \cite{schwarz1988}, by exploiting the large separation of scales between the \textsuperscript{4}He vortex core size $a_0$ and the average inter-vortex spacing $\ell$. 
We parametrize the superfluid vortex lines as 1D space curves $\s(\xi,t)$ with $\xi$ and $t$ the arclength and time respectively. 
The corresponding equation of motion is
\begin{equation}
\dot{\s}(\xi,t) = \v_{s_{\perp}} + \beta\s'\times\v_{ns} + \beta'\s'\times\left[\s'\times\v_{ns}\right]
\end{equation}
where $\s'=\partial\s/\partial\xi$ is the unit tangent vector at $\s$, $\v_{ns} = \v_n - \v_s$ where $\v_n$ and $\v_s$ are the normal fluid and superfluid velocities at $\s$, and $\beta$, $\beta'$ are temperature and Reynolds number dependent mutual friction coefficients. 
The superfluid velocity $\v_s$ is computed via a de-singularized Biot-Savart integral, accelerated using the tree algorithm \cite{baggaley2012d} (see Supplementary Materials).
We describe the normal fluid in a classical way, using the incompressible ($\nabla\cdot\v_n = 0$) Navier-Stokes equation
\begin{equation}
  \pderiv{\v_n}{t} + (\v_n\cdot\nabla)\v_n =  -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu_n\nabla^2\v_n + \frac{\mathbf{F}_{ns}}{\rho_n} 
\end{equation}
where $\rho_n$ and $\rho_s$ are the normal fluid and superfluid densities, $\rho = \rho_n + \rho_s$, $p$ is the pressure, $\nu_n$ is the kinematic viscosity of the normal fluid and $\mathbf{F}_{ns}$ is the mutual friction force per unit volume. 

In this study, we prepare two distinct turbulent vortex tangles generated by (\emph{a}) a $T=2.1$ K thermal counterflow (CF) with an average inter-vortex distance $\ell_{CF}$ and (\emph{b}) a $T=0$ K evolution of a tangle with a Taylor-Green initial condition (TG) with an average inter-vortex spacing $\ell_{TG}$. Both of these tangles are visualized in the left and right panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:snapshots} respectively. The velocity circulation statistics of $\v_s$ are obtained by a vorticity coarse-graining process described in the Supplementary materials. Furthermore, the statistics related to the counterflow are decomposed into the normal fluid $(NF)$ and superfluid $(SF)$ components. Each of these components are further decomposed into the perpendicular $(\perp)$ and $(\parallel)$ components, corresponding to the directions over which statistics are averaged. Perpendicular (parallel) relates to the statistics averaged in the direction where the flux of vorticity through a square loop of size $r$ is perpendicular (parallel) to the counterflow velocity $\v_{ns}$.      

\section{Results}

  \caption{Circulation variance $\langle|\Gamma|^2\rangle$ around square loops of size $r$. The blue and yellow curves show the normal fluid and super fluid simulations respectively, which are subdivided into the perpendicular (circles) and parallel (diamonds) components. The green squares show the Taylor-Green simulation.}
  \label{fig:variance}
\end{figure}


Firstly, we begin by considering the simplest observable for velocity circulation statistic - the variance $\langle|\Gamma|^2\rangle$ for different loop sizes $r$. 
The circulation variance scalings are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:variance}, where we have identified two scaling regimes, a quantum regime $r\ll\ell$ with red shading and a classical regime $r\gtrsim\ell$ with blue shading.
Indeed in the quantum regime we find good agreement for the superfluid velocity statistics with the small-scale theory $\langle|\Gamma^2|\rangle\sim r^{2} $ as discussed in Ref.~\cite{muller2021} using the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model. 
We observe that in this regime the scaling not only follows the GP theory, but the quantum region scaling is independent of thermal effects and the nature of the turbulent driving force.
Similarily, the normal fluid also exhibits the well known viscous scaling of $\langle|\Gamma|^2|\rangle\sim r^4$ for small loop sizes $r$ , as a result of smoothness at very small scales \cite{iyer2019}. 

The cross-over from the quantum $r\ll\ell$ to the classical $r\gtrsim\ell$ marks a stark contrast in the superfluid circulation variance scaling. 
While the TG scales in accordance with a partial polarization of vortices where $r^{8/3}$ \cite{lvov2007}, the CF scaling, appears to follow a scaling of $\sim r^{1.58}$, a weaker scaling than for a fully random tangle of vortex lines which exhibits $r^{2}$ scaling in the classical range. 
Remarkably both components of the SF and NF statistics of CF appear to adhere to this scaling law for loops $r\gtrsim\ell$. 
For the remainder of this paper, we will only focus on the classical range where the loop sizes $r>\ell$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{PDFs.pdf}
  \caption{PDFs of the velocity circulation for different loop sizes $r/\ell > 1$, scaled by the standard deviation $\sigma_{\Gamma}$. (\emph{a}) shows the Taylor-Green simulation, while \emph{(b)} shows both of the normal fluid parallel (diamonds) and perpendicular (circles) components. The inset of (\emph{a}) shows the flatness $\mathcal{K}(\Gamma) = \langle|\Gamma|^4\rangle / \sigma_{\Gamma}^4$, with the same color scheme as in Fig.~\ref{fig:variance}. The black dashed line marks the Gaussian flatness of $\mathcal{K}=3$. See the Supplementary materials for the SF PDFs.}
  \label{fig:PDF}
\end{figure}

 
In fully-developed isotropic classical turbulence, velocity circulation statistics adhere to a strictly non-Gaussian distribution with long tails \cite{wilczek2009}.
Deviations from Gaussian statistics are the hallmark of intermittency, and represent a deviation from self-similar scaling which are evident in the TG simulations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PDF}a.    
The circulation PDF of the NF components differs very strongly (see Fig.~\ref{fig:PDF}b).
Strikingly, we see a complete collapse to Gaussian statistics for the perpendicular components, while the parallel component exhibits very small deviations.
We show this collapse by computing the flatness $\mathcal{K}(\Gamma) = \langle|\Gamma|^4\rangle / \sigma_{\Gamma}^4$, where $\sigma_{\Gamma}$ is the standard deviation $\sqrt{\langle|\Gamma|^2\rangle}$.
The flatness is displayed in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:PDF}a.
In the classical regime the NF components monotonically decay to the Gaussian value of $\mathcal{K} = 3$, while the non-Gaussian TG simulation deviates in the same region. Indeed we observe that the presence of quantized vortices suppresses the intermittent behaviour of the classically-driven NF.  

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{moments.pdf}
  \caption{Circulation moments $\langle|\Gamma|^p\rangle$ in extended self-similarity (ESS) using $p=3$. (\emph{a}) shows the Taylor-Green simulation, while the left and right panels of (\emph{b}) are the normal fluid perpendicular and parallel component respectively. The insets of each plot give the local slope, where $\lambda_p/\lambda_3 = \mathrm{d}\left[\log\langle|\Gamma|^p\rangle\right]/\mathrm{d}\left[\log\langle|\Gamma|^3\rangle\right]$ and the horizontal lines correspond to the K41 scalings $\lambda_p^{K41} = 4p/3$. The shaded regions indicate the classical region where the data used to estimate the exponents.}
  \label{fig:moments}
\end{figure}


As is customary in the classical turbulence, we will characterize the intermittency by measuring the deviation of the circulation moments of order $p$ given by $\langle|\Gamma|^p\rangle$ from the self-similar K41 scaling.
The TG and NF moments are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:moments}, where we have plotted the circulation moments in extended self-similarity (ESS) using the third-order circulation moment $\langle|\Gamma|^3\rangle$. In this way, we define the scaling exponents $\lambda_p$ as  
\begin{equation}
  \langle|\Gamma|^p\rangle\sim \left[\langle|\Gamma|^3\rangle\right]^{(\lambda_p/\lambda_3)p}
\end{equation} 
In order to compute the scaling exponents, we find the local slope of the moments in ESS, which is given by
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{\lambda_p}{\lambda_3}\right)(r) = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left[\log\langle|\Gamma|^p\rangle\right]}{\mathrm{d}\left[\log\langle|\Gamma|^3\rangle\right]}
\end{equation}
As the local-slope of pure power-law functions is flat, we look for flat regions where the loop sizes are $r>\ell$, and then average over the selected regions.
